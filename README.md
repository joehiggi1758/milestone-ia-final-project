# Milestone IA - Masters of Applied Data Science Project

## Overview
This repository contains my capstone project from the Masters of Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan. As the lead student, I explored topics such as private equity, statistical data analysis, econometrics, correlation, and network analysis. I used Python extensively throughout the project, applying best practices in data analysis and project management to achieve meaningful insights. This project was awarded an A, showcasing its quality and depth of analysis.

## Key Highlights
- **Private Equity Analysis**: Conducted a detailed examination of private equity data, revealing key insights into market trends.
- **Statistical Data Analysis**: Applied various statistical techniques to understand data distributions, relationships, and to draw actionable conclusions.
- **Econometrics**: Developed and utilized econometric models to make predictions and understand economic relationships.
- **Correlation and Network Analysis**: Investigated data relationships and created visual representations to demonstrate network structures.
- **Python Programming**: Demonstrated proficiency in Python for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and project management.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main language used for analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Used for creating data visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: Applied econometric models for statistical analysis.
- **NetworkX**: Created network visualizations and analyzed network structures.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed step-by-step data analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for various analysis tasks.
- **visualizations/**: Generated visual outputs such as graphs and network diagrams.
